## How to Organize Videos

1. **Create topic folders**: Each major topic should have its own folder under `topics/`
2. **Video naming convention**: Use descriptive names like:
   - `01-introduction.mp4`
   - `02-basic-concepts.mp4`
   - `03-practical-examples.mp4`

## Supported Video Formats

- MP4 (recommended)
- WebM
- MOV
- AVI

## Integration with Course Content

Videos will be linked to specific topics in the course learning materials. Each video should correspond to a section or concept in the curriculum.

## Notes

- Keep video file sizes reasonable for web delivery
- Consider adding subtitles for accessibility
- Organize videos in logical learning sequence
